# Introduction

In the vast landscape of machine learning, where chaos meets order, clustering emerges as the art of finding hidden patterns and groupings within data. Join me on a journey through the Clustering Chronicles, where algorithms play the role of data detectives, unraveling the mysteries of similarity and dissimilarity.

## The Intrigue of Clustering

Clustering algorithms are the protagonists in our narrative, seeking to discover the underlying structure within datasets. Their adventures lead us to unexpected insights and open new possibilities for understanding complex phenomena.

# K-means Clustering: Orchestrating the Drama

Our first character in the Clustering Chronicles is K-means clustering, a versatile algorithm that partitions data into distinct groups.

```{python}
# Simple addition program
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Get input from the user
num1 = 9
num2 = 9

# Perform addition
result = add_numbers(num1, num2)

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}")
